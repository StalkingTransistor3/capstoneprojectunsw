Your stomach grumbles. You take our your phone to check the time. It's almost been half an hour since you sat down and you had your order in mind as soon as you stepped inside but no-one has come to take it.

We've all been there, and in today culture of hustle and bustle, every second counts. Traditional restaurant services, such as waiting to place orders, standing in lines and dealing with potential miscommunications no longer meet the demands of modern diners. The need to revolutionize the dining experience is indisputable. To address this, we propose the development of an innovative "Wait Management System" (WMS), meticulously designed to minimize friction in the customer dining journey and reduce overhead for busy cafes and restaurants.

This proposal outlines the design, implementation and functionalities of our Wait Management System, focusing on enhancing the dining experience, streamlining staff coordination and optimizing restaurant operations. With this system, customers can digitally select their table, browse the menu and place orders at their leisure and convenience, requesting the bill once satisfied. Additionally, they are also able to request waiter assistance through the system. By integrating these features, WMS aims to bring efficiency and satisfaction to every dining interaction.

Simultaneously, our system provides the kitchen staff with an organized, time-sequenced list of orders, along with the ability to mark prepared orders. Waitstaff receive timely notifications when customers need assistance or when dishes are ready for service, thus eliminating guesswork and reducing service time. The system also enables restaurant managers to modify menu categories and items, enhancing their control over the customer's culinary journey.

Beyond the features mentioned above, our system is designed to include at least eight distinct functionalities and incorporate two innovative features not found in existing wait management systems. These groundbreaking functionalities will address specific customer pain points and further distinguish our system in the market.

Let's examine two notable but flawed systems in the current market landscape:

KFC's wait system, though widely used, has several limitations. It limits payment to cards only and does not offer customers the option to reserve tables in advance for dine-in. Furthermore, it lacks a critical feature our WMS plans to incorporate: the ability for customers to request employee assistance directly through the system. This means our proposed system not only matches the existing service level but also surpasses it, delivering a more comprehensive and customer-centric experience.

Another system, provided by QRmenu.com, also has shortcomings that our proposed system aims to address. Similar to the KFC system, it doesn't allow customers to select a table, it exclusively accepts online payments (which requires owning a smartphone), and it doesn't offer the ability to summon a waiter for assistance. In contrast, our proposed system is designed to accommodate various payment methods, facilitate table selection, and enable direct communication with service staff, catering to a wider demographic of customers with diverse needs and preferences.

In conclusion, our Wait Management System aspires to combine the best features of existing systems while innovating beyond their limitations. Through our system, we seek to redefine the dining experience for customers, while providing restaurants with a comprehensive tool to streamline their operations and deliver exceptional service.
